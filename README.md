## Solution of team "Двоеточие" for [Finnet Challenge](https://job.tochka.com/challenge)

So, the best score was achieved with an [ensemble](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/ensembling.ipynb) of 7 boostings using 256-dim node2vec [embeddings](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/embeddings.ipynb) + some aggregation features.

We also tried things like graph neural networks, recommendation based on adjacency matrix factorization and nearest neighbors, but these solutions had bad public results.

[Mixing some solutions up](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/bloodmixing.ipynb) sometimes improved results
