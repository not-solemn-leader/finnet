So, the [best score](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/ensembling.ipynb](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/ensembling.ipynb) was achieved with an ensemble of 7 boostings using 256-dim node2vec embeddings + some aggregation features (ensemble.ipynb).

We also tried things like graph neural networks, recommendation based on adjacency matrix factorization and nearest neighbors, but these solutions had bad public results.

[Mixing some solutions up]((https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/ensembling.ipynb](https://github.com/not-solemn-leader/finnet/blob/master/bloodmixing.ipynb)) sometimes improved results
